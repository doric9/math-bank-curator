      "problem": "A rectangular garden has a length of 12 meters and a width of 8 meters. If you want to build a fence around the entire garden, how many meters of fencing will you need?",
      "solution": "To find the amount of fencing needed, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle.\n\nPerimeter of a rectangle = 2 × (length + width)\n\nStep 1: Add length and width\n12 + 8 = 20 meters\n\nStep 2: Multiply by 2\n2 × 20 = 40 meters\n\nTherefore, you will need 40 meters of fencing.",

      "problem": "Sarah has $150 in her savings account. Each month, she deposits $25. How much money will she have after 6 months?",
      "solution": "To find the total amount after 6 months, we need to add the monthly deposits to the initial amount.\n\nStep 1: Calculate total deposits\nMonthly deposit × number of months = $25 × 6 = $150\n\nStep 2: Add to initial amount\nInitial amount + total deposits = $150 + $150 = $300\n\nTherefore, Sarah will have $300 after 6 months.",

      "problem": "A bag contains 5 red marbles, 3 blue marbles, and 2 green marbles. If you randomly pick one marble from the bag, what is the probability of picking a blue marble?",
      "solution": "Probability is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nStep 1: Find the total number of marbles\nTotal = 5 red + 3 blue + 2 green = 10 marbles\n\nStep 2: Identify favorable outcomes\nNumber of blue marbles = 3\n\nStep 3: Calculate probability\nProbability = Number of blue marbles / Total marbles\nProbability = 3/10 = 0.3 or 30%\n\nTherefore, the probability of picking a blue marble is 3/10 or 30%.",

      "problem": "Solve for x: 3x + 7 = 22",
      "solution": "To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation.\n\nStep 1: Subtract 7 from both sides\n3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7\n3x = 15\n\nStep 2: Divide both sides by 3\n3x ÷ 3 = 15 ÷ 3\nx = 5\n\nStep 3: Verify the solution\n3(5) + 7 = 15 + 7 = 22 ✓\n\nTherefore, x = 5.",
