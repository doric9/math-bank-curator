      "problem": "Makayla finds all the possible ways to draw a path in a 5 \u00d7 5 diamond-shaped grid. Each path starts at the bottom of the grid and ends at the top, always moving one unit northeast or northwest. She computes the area of the region between each path and the right side of the grid. Two examples are shown in the figures below. What is the sum of the areas determined by all possible paths?",
      "solution": "1. **Analyze the Grid and Paths:**\n   The problem describes a $5 \\times 5$ diamond-shaped grid. This is topologically equivalent to a $5 \\times 5$ square grid rotated by 45 degrees. A path from the bottom to the top consists of 10 steps in total: 5 steps Northeast (NE) and 5 steps Northwest (NW). Let's denote a NE step as a 'Right' move and a NW step as a 'Left' move (relative to the rotated grid orientation).\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Paths:**\n   The number of distinct paths from the start to the end is the number of ways to arrange 5 NE steps and 5 NW steps. This is given by the binomial coefficient:\n   $$\\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{10!}{5!5!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{120} = 252$$\n   So, there are 252 possible paths.\n\n3. **Analyze the Area:**\n   The total area of the $5 \\times 5$ grid is $5 \\times 5 = 25$ unit squares (or rhombi, in the diamond shape).\n   For any given path $P$, let $A_R(P)$ be the area between the path and the right side of the grid, and $A_L(P)$ be the area between the path and the left side of the grid.\n   Since the path divides the total grid area into two parts, we have:\n   $$A_R(P) + A_L(P) = \\text{Total Area} = 25$$\n\n4. **Use Symmetry:**\n   The grid and the rules of movement are symmetric. For every path $P$, there exists a symmetric path $P'$ (the reflection of $P$ across the vertical axis of the diamond). The area between $P$ and the right side is equal to the area between $P'$ and the left side.\n   $$A_R(P) = A_L(P')$$\n   \n   We want to find the sum of the areas between all paths and the right side: $S = \\sum_{P} A_R(P)$.\n   Consider the sum of the areas for both sides over all paths:\n   $$\\sum_{P} (A_R(P) + A_L(P)) = \\sum_{P} 25$$\n   Since there are 252 paths:\n   $$\\sum_{P} A_R(P) + \\sum_{P} A_L(P) = 252 \\times 25$$\n   \n   Due to symmetry, the sum of areas relative to the right side must equal the sum of areas relative to the left side ($\\sum A_R = \\sum A_L$). Therefore:\n   $$2 \\times \\sum_{P} A_R(P) = 252 \\times 25$$\n   $$S = \\frac{252 \\times 25}{2}$$\n\n5. **Final Calculation:**\n   $$S = 126 \\times 25$$\n   $$S = 3150$$\n\nThe sum of the areas determined by all possible paths is 3150.",
