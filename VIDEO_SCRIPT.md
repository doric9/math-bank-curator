# Math Bank Curator - Demo Video Script

**Total Duration**: ~60 Seconds
**Visual Style**: Minimalist, "Google Assistant" aesthetic. Clean white background. Primary colors (Blue, Red, Yellow, Green). Smooth, fluid animations.

| Time | Visual Description | Voiceover (VO) |

| **0:00 - 0:08** | **Scene 1: The Problem**<br>A chaotic pile of papers and math symbols (∑, π, x, y) accumulates in the center. A stick figure "teacher" looks overwhelmed. The background is stark white. | Creating high-quality math problems is exhausting. It's repetitive, time-consuming, and hard to scale. |
| **0:08 - 0:15** | **Scene 2: The Solution**<br>The chaos shrinks and implodes into a single point, then expands into the clean text "Math Bank Curator". Geometric shapes (triangle, circle, square) float gently around it. | Introducing Math Bank Curator. An autonomous agentic workflow that builds your problem bank for you. |
| **0:15 - 0:28** | **Scene 3: The Agentic Advantage**<br>Split screen: Left side shows a single robot saying "I think this is right?". Right side shows our three agents (Blue, Red, Green). The Green agent rejects a bad idea from Red, then accepts a good one. | Why agents? A single AI model can make mistakes. Math Bank Curator uses a multi-agent system to separate concerns. The Generator is the creative spark. The Validator is the strict, independent critic. |
| **0:28 - 0:38** | **Scene 4: Validation Loop**<br>Animation of a feedback loop: Red sends a problem -> Green checks it -> Green sends feedback "Too easy" -> Red improves it -> Green accepts it. | They collaborate. If a problem isn't perfect, the Validator rejects it. They refine it together until it meets the highest standard. |
| **0:35 - 0:45** | **Scene 5: Multimodal**<br>An image of a geometry triangle transforms into Python code, then re-renders as a perfect digital diagram. | It's fully multimodal. It sees diagrams in PDFs and writes code to render perfect geometric figures. |
| **0:45 - 0:53** | **Scene 6: The Bank**<br>Validated problems fly into a secure, stylized vault door. The door closes and locks with a satisfying click. | Only the best problems make it into the bank. Ready for your students, instantly. |
| **0:53 - 1:00** | **Scene 7: Outro**<br>The vault fades. The text "Math Bank Curator" returns. Below it, "Powered by Gemini 3" appears with the Gemini sparkle animation. | Math Bank Curator. Autonomous. Rigorous. Infinite. Powered by Gemini 3. |
