      "solution": "To find the percentage of the grid covered by the star, we calculate the area of the star relative to the total area of the grid.\n\n1. **Calculate Total Area:**\n   The grid is \\(4 \\times 4\\), so the total area is:\n   \\[ \\text{Total Area} = 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\text{ square units} \\]\n\n2. **Analyze the Star's Area:**\n   We can determine the area of the star by decomposing the grid into 16 unit squares (\\(1 \\times 1\\)) and counting the shaded portions.\n   *   **Center:** The star typically has a solid center occupying the middle \\(2 \\times 2\\) section of the grid. This consists of 4 fully shaded unit squares.\n       \\[ \\text{Center Area} = 4 \\]\n   *   **Points:** The points of the star are formed in the 8 unit squares surrounding the center (excluding the 4 unshaded corners).

      "problem": "The table below shows the Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs that were used to represent different numbers: a vertical stroke (|) represents 1, a heel bone (arch) represents 10, a coiled rope (scroll) represents 100, and a lotus flower represents 1000.

      "solution": "To determine the number, we identify the value of each symbol and sum them up:\n\n1. **Lotus Flowers**: There are 2 lotus flowers.

The second rectangle (R2) is a rotation of the first, so it has the same dimensions and area. Area(R2) = 24 square inches.\n\n3. To find the total area covered, we use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion: Total Area = Area(R1) + Area(R2) - Area(Intersection).\n\n4. Let's determine the geometry of the intersection. Set the midpoint of side BC as the origin (0,0) of a coordinate plane.\n   - Since BC = 6 and lies on the vertical axis (before rotation), the coordinates of B are (0, 3) and C are (0, -3).\n   - Since AB = 4, the original rectangle R1 spans x from -4 to 0 and y from -3 to 3.\n\n5.

Three tetrominoes are used to completely cover a 3x4 rectangle. At least one of the tiles is an L tile. What are the other two tiles?",
      "solution": "1. **Analyze the Area**: A 3x4 rectangle has an area of 12 square units. Since each tetromino has an area of 4, exactly 3 tetrominoes are required to cover the rectangle.\n\n2. **Coloring Argument (Parity)**: Color the 3x4 grid in a checkerboard pattern (black and white). There will be 6 black squares and 6 white squares.\n   - The I, O, and S tetrominoes always cover 2 black and 2 white squares. Their contribution to the color balance (Black - White) is 0.\n   - The T and L tetrominoes always cover 3 squares of one color and 1 of the other. Their contribution to the balance is +2 or -2.\n\n3. **Determine Necessary Pieces**: For the total grid to be balanced (0), the sum of the balances of the three pieces must be 0.\n   - We are given one L tile (balance +/- 2).\n   - To reach a net sum of 0, we need another piece with the opposite balance (+/- 2). This implies we need a second piece that is either an L or a T.\n   - The third piece must have a balance of 0, meaning it must be an I, O, or S tile.\n   - So, the set of tiles is {L, (L or T), (I or O or S)}.\n\n4. **Geometric Constraints**: \n   - Consider the I-tile. In a 3x4 grid, an I-tile (4x1) can only fit horizontally. If we place an I-tile, the remaining area is a 2x4 rectangle.\n   - We must cover this 2x4 area with the remaining two pieces (which we know are L and either L or T).\n   - **Case A: {L, T}**: It is impossible to tile a 2x4 rectangle with one L and one T tile.\n   - **Case B: {L, L}**: It is possible to tile a 2x4 rectangle with two L tiles (they interlock to form a 2x4 block).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the only geometrically valid combination that satisfies the parity constraint involves an I-tile and two L-tiles, and we already have one L-tile, the other two tiles must be an L-tile and an I-tile.",

There are 105 silver squares, so the number of gold squares is $200 - 105 = 95$.\n\nWhen the grid is folded in half vertically, it forms $10 \\times 10 = 100$ pairs of overlapping unit squares.\n\nLet the pairs be defined by the colors of the two overlapping squares:\n- Let $x$ be the number of Gold-Gold pairs.\n- Let $y$ be the number of Gold-Silver (mixed) pairs.\n- Let $z$ be the number of Silver-Silver pairs.\n\nWe can set up the following equations based on the total count of pairs and the total count of colored squares:\n1. Total pairs: $x + y + z = 100$\n2. Total gold squares: $2x + y = 95$\n3.

Since $y$ represents a count of pairs, $y \\ge 0$. Therefore:\n$95 - 2x \\ge 0 \\implies 2x \\le 95 \\implies x \\le 47.5$.\nSince $x$ must be an integer, the maximum possible value is $M = 47$.\n\nLet's verify $M=47$ is achievable:\nIf $x = 47$, then $y = 95 - 2(47) = 1$.\nSubstituting into equation (3): $1 + 2z = 105 \\implies 2z = 104 \\implies z = 52$.\nCheck total pairs: $47 + 1 + 52 = 100$.

To minimize $x$, we must maximize $y$.\nThe maximum value of $y$ is constrained by the total number of gold squares (95) and the total number of silver squares (105). Thus, $y$ cannot exceed 95. Also, since $2x = 95 - y$, $95 - y$ must be an even number, meaning $y$ must be odd.\nLet's try the maximum possible odd value $y = 95$.\nIf $y = 95$, then $2x = 95 - 95 = 0 \\implies x = 0$.\nLet's verify $m=0$ is achievable:\nIf $x = 0$ and $y = 95$, substitute into equation (3): $95 + 2z = 105 \\implies 2z = 10 \\implies z = 5$.\nCheck total pairs: $0 + 95 + 5 = 100$.

      "problem": "Five distinct integers from 1 to 10 are chosen, and five distinct integers from 11 to 20 are chosen. No two numbers differ by exactly 10. What is the sum of the ten chosen numbers?",
      "solution": "Let set $A = \\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$ and set $B = \\{11, 12, \\dots, 20\\}$. We choose a subset $S_A \\subset A$ with $|S_A| = 5$ and a subset $S_B \\subset B$ with $|S_B| = 5$. The total set of chosen numbers is $S = S_A \\cup S_B$, with $|S|=10$.\n\nThe condition states that no two numbers differ by exactly 10. Consider the pairs $(k, k+10)$ for $k = 1, 2, \\dots, 10$. There are exactly 10 such pairs covering all integers from 1 to 20. \n\nIf we select both numbers from a pair (e.g., $k$ and $k+10$), their difference is 10, which is not allowed. Therefore, we can select at most one number from each pair.\n\nSince we must select a total of 10 numbers and there are only 10 pairs available, we must select exactly one number from each pair $(k, k+10)$.\n\nThe sum of the chosen numbers can be calculated by looking at the contribution of each pair. For each $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, 10\\}$, we choose either $k$ or $k+10$. This can be written as choosing $k + \\delta_k$, where $\\delta_k \\in \\{0, 10\\}$.\n\nThe total sum is:\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{10} (k + \\delta_k) = \\sum_{k=1}^{10} k + \\sum_{k=1}^{10} \\delta_k $$\n\nThe first part is the sum of integers from 1 to 10:\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{10} k = \\frac{10(11)}{2} = 55 $$\n\nFor the second part, we know that exactly 5 numbers are chosen from set $B$ (where values are $k+10$, so $\\delta_k=10$) and 5 numbers are chosen from set $A$ (where values are $k$, so $\\delta_k=0$). Thus, there are five $10$s and five $0$s.\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{10} \\delta_k = 5 \\times 10 + 5 \\times 0 = 50 $$\n\nThe total sum is $55 + 50 = 105$.",
